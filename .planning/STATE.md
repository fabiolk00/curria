# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-16)

**Core value:** A job seeker can reliably turn their real profile and a target role into an honest, ATS-ready resume output they can confidently download and use.
**Current focus:** Architecture hardening for critical route semantics is complete; the next milestone action is milestone audit and closeout.

## Current Position

Phase: 60 (pending resume generation persistence narrowing) - COMPLETE
Plan: 01 complete
Current Phase: 60
Current Phase Name: pending resume generation persistence narrowing
Current Plan: 01
Total Plans in Phase: 1
Status: Phase complete - verified locally
Last activity: 2026-04-21
Last Activity Description: Pending resume-generation persistence now distinguishes create vs reuse failures, logs raw DB diagnostics, and preserves narrower failure codes through the billable-path tool log

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Performance Metrics

- Milestones archived: 5

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.6 remained focused on async runtime hardening first, then route-architecture hardening for sensitive surfaces.
- Phase 48 extracted explicit route context, policy, decision, and response seams.
- Phase 49 hardened those seams with boundary docs, seam tests, and hotspot guardrails.
- Phase 50 completed: smart-generation and session-generate decision hotspots are now decomposed into route-specific orchestration helpers.
- Phase 51 completed: locked preview, compare, versions, and response mappings now have executable invariants and exhaustive seams.
- Phase 52 completed: route architecture anti-patterns are enforced by CI audit and PR checklist prompts.
- Phase 53 completed: architecture telemetry counters and incident drill docs now cover locked and artifact-available flows.
- Phase 54 completed: a curated architecture proof pack, scorecard, and approved chokepoint map now gate sensitive route behavior.
- Phase 55 completed: compare ownership is canonicalized, comparison is extracted into route layers, and repo-topology docs now match the current architecture.
- Phase 56 completed: CI now runs the architecture proof pack, the audit enforces compare/comparison/versions seams, and governance docs reflect the enforced critical-route surface.
- Phase 57 completed: temporary planning/debug leftovers are cleaned up, architecture docs have a canonical index, and planning hygiene rules are now documented.
- Phase 58 completed: the ATS enhancement to generate_file handoff now validates authoritative source coherence before export, preserves typed precondition failures, and is regression-tested across smart-generation and preview-lock flows.

### Decisions

- Keep critical route hardening route-specific; do not build a generic route framework.
- Preserve public behavior while reducing semantic density.
- Treat preview-lock, replay, compare, versions, and file-access contracts as executable invariants.
- Enforce obvious route anti-patterns in CI instead of relying on review memory.
- Use a curated proof pack rather than the entire test suite as the release-facing architecture gate.
- [Phase 55]: Keep POST /api/session/[id]/compare as the canonical compare seam; keep GET /api/session/[id]/comparison compatibility-only.
- [Phase 55]: Preserve preview-lock sanitization in the comparison decision layer before resume text generation or scoring.
- [Phase 55]: README stays onboarding-focused and links to architecture docs instead of restating them.
- [Phase 55]: approved-chokepoints.md remains unchanged because session-comparison/decision.ts is not a new monitored chokepoint.
- [Phase 56]: CI enforcement must match the PR checklist for critical-route changes.
- [Phase 56]: The route-architecture audit must enforce `compare`, `comparison`, and `versions` alongside the previously audited critical surfaces.
- [Phase 56]: The architecture proof pack now includes the `comparison` route plus its seam tests.
- [Phase 57]: `.planning/.tmp-copy-audit.json` and `.planning/debug/` are local-only artifacts and must stay ignored.
- [Phase 57]: Historical phase directories remain canonical project memory when they explain real decisions, even if they are old.
- [Phase 58]: `generate_file` uses session-backed source resolution as the authoritative export source; payload `cv_state` is now validated for coherence instead of treated as an equal source of truth.
- [Phase 58]: Smart-generation performs a post-persistence handoff preflight before dispatching `generate_file`.
- [Phase 58]: Intake and handoff coherence problems surface as typed `PRECONDITION_FAILED` failures instead of opaque internal-error exceptions where possible.
- [Phase 59]: The remaining opaque post-preflight failure path is now localized inside `generateBillableResume(...)` with explicit billable stages, stage-aware logs, and stage-failure metrics.
- [Phase 59]: Known billable state failures such as missing latest version, missing pending generation, reservation failures, render throws, and persistence failures now preserve stable typed codes or stage-tagged exceptions instead of collapsing into an unqualified opaque throw.
- [Phase 60]: Pending resume-generation persistence failures now distinguish create vs reuse branches, preserve raw DB diagnostics, and surface narrower billable failure codes for this hotspot.
- [Phase 61]: `resume_generations` create persistence now writes `updated_at` explicitly on insert so direct Supabase inserts stay aligned with the table contract and the existing update path.
- [Phase 59]: The remaining opaque post-preflight failure path is now localized inside `generateBillableResume(...)` with explicit billable stages, stage-aware logs, and stage-failure metrics.
- [Phase 59]: Known billable state failures such as missing latest version, missing pending generation, reservation failures, render throws, and persistence failures now preserve stable typed codes or stage-tagged exceptions instead of collapsing into an unqualified opaque throw.
